TO-DO:

-> choosePlayer() - needs to be random (CHECK)
-> changeTurn() -  switch player number (CHECK)
-> checkMove() - if no 2 or more pieces are in the same place
               - if no move can be done, player loses
               - moves horizontally or vertically
               - cant jump over another piece
               - cant change directions during move
               
-> capture() - move a piece horizontally or vertically adjacent to opponent's piece
             - captured piece must be in a "sandwich" between own pieces
             - more than one stone can be captured simultaneously in the previous manner if the rules above still apply
                ex: Friend Enemy Friend Enemy Friend -> 2 Enemy pieces captured
            
- a piece is free to move between two of an opponent's pieces without being captured
- capture is not mandatory unless stated

-> removePiece() - capture pieces are removed from the board
-> incrementScore() - adds one (1) to the player's score who captured a piece

- playing not to win == player loses
